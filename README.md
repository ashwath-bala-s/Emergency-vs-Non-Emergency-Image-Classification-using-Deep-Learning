# Emergency vs Non-Emergency Image Classification using Deep Learning

**Introduction:**

Accurately distinguishing between emergency and non-emergency situations is critical for prompt and effective responses in various sectors, including healthcare, public safety, and disaster management. Leveraging deep learning for image classification can significantly enhance the speed and accuracy of identifying emergencies, thereby improving decision-making and resource allocation. This project aims to utilize deep learning techniques to classify images into emergency and non-emergency categories, enabling faster and more reliable identification of critical situations.

**Problem Statement:**
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that classifies images as either emergency or non-emergency. By training the model on a diverse dataset of images, the neural network will learn to identify visual cues and patterns indicative of emergency situations.

**Dataset:**

The Datasets used for this Project are:

(i) Images Folder - Containing 2351 Images of both Emergency and Non-Emergency Vehicles

(ii) emergency_classification.csv - Contains the image name and correct class of 2351 Images

**Project Description:**

• Performed Image Pre-Processing steps such as reshaping, and normalizing images, converting them to a 1-dimensional format and scaling pixel values between 0 and 1 for consistent model input.

• Developed, compiled, and trained a deep learning model for image classification based on vehicles.

• Implemented Early Stopping, Model Checkpointing to optimize performance. 

• Achieved an model accuracy of 67%
